## Success Metrics

We will track the following metrics to measure our open source success:

1. **Community Growth**
   - Number of unique contributors
   - Geographic distribution of contributors
   - Contributor retention rate

2. **Project Activity**
   - Pull request frequency and merge rate
   - Issue resolution time
   - Release frequency

3. **Adoption**
   - Number of deployments/installations
   - User community size
   - Citations in academic/industry publications

4. **Code Quality**
   - Test coverage percentage
   - Security vulnerability resolution time
   - Code review thoroughness

## Next Steps

The immediate focus is on implementing the Community Engagement items from Phase 1, which will establish the foundation for a vibrant open source community around the EHR Wallet project.
