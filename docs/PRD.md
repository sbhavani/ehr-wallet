# EHR Wallet - Product Roadmap

## Project Overview

EHR Wallet is a decentralized application that empowers patients to securely own, manage, and share their health data using blockchain technology and FHIR standards.

**Vision:** To create the most advanced, standards-compliant blockchain health wallet that enables true patient data ownership while maintaining interoperability with existing healthcare systems (Epic, Cerner, etc.).

## Current Status

### Implemented Features

- **Patient Authentication** - Dual-mode (traditional + Web3/Polygon wallet)
- **Patient Dashboard** - Central hub with tabs for Shared Data, Health Data, Appointments
- **Data Sharing** - Multi-step wizard with time-limited access and optional password protection
- **Access Logs** - Comprehensive record of who accessed data, when, and IPFS pin status
- **Blockchain Integration** - Polygon smart contracts for access control with IPFS storage
- **MetaMask Wallet** - Integration for blockchain interactions
- **PWA Support** - Installable progressive web app with offline capabilities
- **FHIR R4 Support** - Full HL7 FHIR R4 implementation with Patient, Encounter, Appointment resources

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Compliance & Safety (Current Priority)

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| HIPAA Compliance Framework | Not Started | 🔴 Critical |
| Emergency Access Protocols | Not Started | 🔴 Critical |
| Provider Verification System | Not Started | 🔴 High |
| PostgreSQL Migration | Not Started | 🔴 High |

**Timeline:** Q2-Q3 2025

#### Emergency Access Protocols
